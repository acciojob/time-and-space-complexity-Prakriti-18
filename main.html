	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Space complexity is a measure of the amount of working memory an algorithm requires to run to completion,
		expressed as a function of the size of its input. It is a critical factor for evaluating an algorithm's overall efficiency and its ability to handle large datasets, particularly in environments with limited memory. </p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute, relative to the size of its input.
		It is typically expressed using Big O notation or O(n), which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of memory usage as the input size increases.</p>
