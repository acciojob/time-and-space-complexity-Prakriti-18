	<h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of its input grows. 
		It is a fundamental concept in computer science used to analyze the efficiency of algorithms. An efficient algorithm is one that achieves its task with minimal resource consumption, particularly in terms of time. </p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute, relative to the size of its input.
		It is typically expressed using Big O notation or O(n), which provides an upper bound on the growth rate of memory usage as the input size increases.</p>
